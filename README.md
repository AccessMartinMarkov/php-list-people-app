# php-list-people-app

Motivation:
After completing the procedural PHP for beginners course at https://drupalize.me/topic/php
I have decided to put in practice everything I have learned and build this CRUD PHP people list app.
Please note that there is not much of CSS styling in the app as my main focus was the PHP functionality.

Functionality:
Create person, update person, see person details and delete person.

How to setup the app locally:
 - Clone the repo to your local
 - You can use any local php environment to get the app running, in my case I was using XAMPP.
 - create database and make sure you are using the correct database details which you can find in the lib/db_config.php file 
 or just update the lib/db_config.php file with your newly created database details
 - In the root folder of the project you can find database file called people.sql with two persons already added to it,
 please import that file to your database so you have all the necessary database tables and structure ready for use.
 
 Please note that if you have any path issues using the navigation menu, 
 you may want to copy all the files inside of php-list-people-app folder and move them to the root of your local environment.
